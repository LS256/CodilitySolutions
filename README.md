# CodilitySolutions
In this repo I am going to upload my solutions for codility task - but only these where I got 100% in performance.

1. MashroomPicker - this solution is an answer for exercisec placed in explatanion of prefix sums to lesson 5. It was so addictive for that i couldn't stop thinking about it's solution. It's also learnt me one important think.. always try to analyze code and it's border conditions.

2. Lesson 6 - "Stone wall" - this allowed to make brain storm. This task traped me a while as I wanted to make it from another point of view - not create blocks when they appear but I wanted to create blocks when they disappear. But nevertheless It was really good brain storm exercise - that's why I appriciate codility.
